Version: 1.8.19
EmailSubject: Onkyo Network Remote Plugin Update
EmailBody: The Onkyo Network Remote Plugin for Indigo has been updated to version 1.8.19 and may be downloaded at http://www.duncanware.com/Downloads/IndigoHomeAutomation/Plugins/OnkyoNetworkRemote/OnkyoNetworkRemote.zip.

This is a minor update that addresses two specific issues:
* Fixes bug for receivers returning slightly different formatted volume returns
* Allows installation of plugin when download has been renamed

Every effort has been made to ensure that the plugin works across Onkyo receivers, but bugs very well may exist. Please report anything you find on the forums!

This email was sent to you because the update checker was enabled; only one email will be sent for this version update. If you wish to stop receiving update notifications, you may turn off the feature from the Niles Audio Receiver's configuration screen found via the Plugins menu within Indigo. If you have any problems or need assistance with the plugin, please visit the forum at http://www.perceptiveautomation.com/userforum/viewforum.php?f=146.

Thanks!
